      question: "How do I know when the program starts?",
      answer: "WiEP hosts two cohorts each yearâ€”one in spring and another in autumn. They're announced in advance. Fill out our sign-up form, follow us on X, and join our Discord server to stay informed about important dates and announcements."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a selection process?",
      answer: "Yes. Depending on the number of applications, we may check your GitHub account to ensure participants meet basic requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "I don't know much about the Ethereum Protocol. Can I still apply?",
      answer: "Yes. Gaps in knowledge are expected. We ask that you have at least some coding experience and a strong motivation to learn. If you feel inspired to dive in, we still encourage you to apply."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I learn how to build smart contracts and dApps?",
      answer: "No. This program primarily focuses on protocol-level contributions rather than building decentralized applications (dApps). Participants often work on GitHub issues related to Ethereum clients."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the WiEP Study Group remote?",
      answer: "Yes. WiEP is global and operates primarily online. We do our best to accommodate participants from different time zones."

      question: "Will I get paid?",
      answer: "No. This is a free initiative, and there is no financial compensation for participation."
